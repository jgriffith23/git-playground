    <h1> Why, hello there! </h1>

    <p> Welcome to this weird little project. There's not much here (understatement of the century--this place looks awful!), but I'm hoping you'll be one of many people to change that.<p>

    <p>See, a lot of stuff about being a developer is hard to grok at first. But you know what's really hard? Like, so hard that even if you've built an entire amazing, working, badass application, you still might have trouble with it at first? </p>

    <h2> GIT >:-/ </h2>

    <p>OMG git branching and pushing to remote repos and merging conflicts is kind of awful the first time you do it. A bunch of us just finished a hackathon, and the hardest part was fixing our own merge conflicts. </p>

    <p>So I figured hell, I need to make a thing I don't care too much about, add features to it, commit, push, and make myself a toy git repo to practice on. If you want to try playing with this repo too, go for it. Fork it, clone it, do something fun, and send me a pull request. I'll probably accept your changes. :) </p>

    <p>After all, I need practice with merge conflicts! O.o </p>

    <p>#ourincrediblegitjourney (Or something equally corny. But for serious, if you use this silly hashtag, link to your post in your next pull request or something.)</p>

## Mission Statement

Why, hello! Welcome to a weird little project. There's not much here 
(understatement of the century --- just look at my CSS), but I'm hoping you'll 
be one of many people to change that.

This repository exists to be broken. Of the tools developers have to learn, git
can be one of the most intimidating and stressful to use. I honestly think that
is partly because of how we all talk about it --- git doesn't have to be scary
if you're careful. But the the first time you run into a merge conflict or
write a bunch of code that breaks everything and need to roll back, even if
you've been very careful, you may find yourself at a loss.

During my first hackathon, my team's biggest problems were dealing with merge
conflicts because we had little experience collaborating with git. I'm much more
comfortable dealing with them now, but at the time, I came home just feeling
like I should practice git commands all night.

So I figured hell, I'll make a thing I don't care much about, add features to 
it, commit, push, and make myself a toy git repo to practice on. If you want to 
try playing with this repo too, go for it. Fork it, clone it, do something fun, 
and send me a pull request. I'll probably accept your changes.

After all, I could still use the practice with merge conflicts. :)

Let us begin **#ourincrediblegitjourney**.

(Or something equally corny. But for serious, if you use this silly hashtag, 
link to your post in your next pull request or something.)


## General Git Tips

Add your own if you've got 'em!

* [One of my favorite Git cheat sheets](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)

* When you fork, be sure to clone *your* repo to your machine.

* [Configuring a Remote for a Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/) 
  (My repo would be your upstream.)

* [Syncing a Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/)

* A pull request != the `git pull` command! You'll have to go to the GitHub 
  website to make a pull request for me to merge your changes.

* When you fork, create a new branch and push to that, rather than pushing to 
  master. 

* If you need to overwrite an author in your repo, try [this script](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-author-info/).

  happen to all of us and the git commands to fix them!
